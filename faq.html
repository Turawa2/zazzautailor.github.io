                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Have you ever stood in front of a mirror and couldn’t decide
                         whether or not something fits? Well, your tailor is the one who
                          understands exactly how clothes should fit, especially your 
                          suit. If you ask your tailor, he’ll be able to explain which
                           parts of your suit need adjusting to achieve the right fit for 
                           you, whether a loose or slim flit. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a
                            tailor go 
                        with you every time you try on new clothes and need an expert opinion?</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Good things can take some time, but if you need a suit fitted for
                         a wedding next week, you’ll need to get on that ASAP. Asking about
                          the timeline of the tailoring process can help relieve your worries
                           and help you plan accordingly. Make sure you give your tailor a 
                        timeline that’s realistic and accommodates your deadlines. Time is money.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>If your tailor doesn’t know how to take measurements,
                         we’d say that probably means it’s time to find a new 
                         tailor. Any good tailor knows how to take proper measurements. 
                         Your tailor should know how to measure men’s inseam since this is
                          a basic measurement he will need to alter your suit pants properly. 
                          You can ask about his technique over the phone or during your 
                          consultation 
                        to make sure that the measurements will be on point.</p>

                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>If you’ve been wondering how much a suit jacket can be taken in, you’re not
                         alone. Join the club. This is one of the most important questions to ask your tailor,  and for good reason. Tailors can only take in so much of your suit. So, in order to fit your needs and fit into your suit jacket, it’s important to ask your tailor how much your specific jacket can be taken in. This way, you’ll know what to expect and be able to make sure that your suit jacket fits just like you want it to.</p>

                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Before you cross your T’s and dot your I’s, you have to understand what it costs to tailor a suit. This is a question that should be asked before the process even begins. When using a professional tailoring service,
                         fabrication, customization and the type of alteration you need can all impact the average cost to tailor a suit. For example, if your tailor provides customization through design and construction services, then expect the price to be higher than it would be if he was just hemming your pants. A professional tailor is worth every penny.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Whether you’re using an NJ tailor or one in the tri-state area, it’s important to ask your tailor about his limitations on alterations. 
                        A sign of a good tailor is one who can pull off difficult alterations, such as shortening a jacket sleeve. Being able to handle more complicated fixes is what separates top tailors from the rest. However, your tailor may not provide every service under the sun. So, be sure to give him a call and check what he can and cannot do. Everything — and every outfit — has its limits.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Say you have a big event coming up and are in the process of either
                         losing or gaining weight for it. We’ve all been there,
                         and this is definitely something you and your tailor have 
                         to take into consideration. If your weight changes post-suit
                         alterations, you’ll need to make adjustments to your suit for the perfect fit. Don’t forget to ask your tailor how they handle the refitting process, including any extra costs you should expect.</p>
